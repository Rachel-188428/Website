# Website
[Note to self] 
Things to add:<br>
CS project links<br>
Update all photos<br>
Update all icons (fix icon3 and icon5)<br>
Fix the off centered buttons (or is it the text)<br>
Update work experience specialties<br>
Find a way to add more detail with work experiences and projects? [Thinking about adding a pop up that will give more detail, hover over with mouse and it'll show the work and project details]<br>
Implement php into the code (test using databases)<br>
